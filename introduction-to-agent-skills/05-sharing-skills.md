# Introduction to Agent Skills — Lesson 5

Course: [Introduction to Agent Skills](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/introduction-to-agent-skills) (Anthropic Academy / Skilljar)
Lesson: Sharing skills · Estimated time: 20 minutes

## What you'll learn

By the end of this lesson you'll be able to:

- Share skills with your team by committing them to a Git repository
- Distribute skills across projects through plugins and marketplaces
- Deploy skills organization-wide using enterprise managed settings
- Configure custom subagents to use specific skills

## Key takeaways

- Project skills in `.claude/skills` are shared automatically through Git — anyone who clones the repo gets them.
- Plugins let you distribute skills across repositories via marketplaces for broader community use.
- Enterprise managed settings deploy skills organization-wide with the highest priority, ideal for mandatory standards and compliance.
- Subagents don't automatically see your skills — you must explicitly list skills in a custom agent's frontmatter `skills` field.
- Built-in agents (Explorer, Plan, Verify) can't access skills at all — only custom subagents defined in `.claude/agents` can.

## Why share skills

A PR review skill that only you use is helpful, but that same skill shared across your entire team standardizes code review and creates a consistent experience across your organization.

## Committing skills to your repository

The simplest sharing method is committing skills directly to your repository. Place them in `.claude/skills`, and anyone who clones the repo gets those skills automatically — no extra installation needed. When you push updates, everyone gets them on the next pull.

This approach works well for:

- Team coding standards
- Project-specific workflows
- Skills that reference your codebase structure

The `.claude` directory contains your agents, hooks, skills, and settings — all version-controlled and shared with the team through normal Git workflows.

## Distributing skills through plugins

Plugins are a way to extend Claude Code with custom functionality designed to be shared across teams and projects. In your plugin project, create a skills directory that follows a similar file structure to the `.claude` directory — each skill gets its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside.

After you distribute your plugin to a marketplace, other users can discover and install it into Claude Code for themselves. This approach is best when your skills aren't too project-specific and can be useful to community members beyond your immediate team.

## Enterprise deployment through managed settings

Administrators can deploy skills organization-wide through managed settings. Enterprise skills take the highest priority — they override personal, project, and plugin skills with the same name.

The managed settings file supports features like `strictKnownMarketplaces` to control where plugins can be installed from:

```json
"strictKnownMarketplaces": [
  {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
  },
  {
    "source": "npm",
    "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
  }
]
```

This is the right choice for mandatory standards, security requirements, compliance workflows, and coding practices that must be consistent across the organization. The keyword here is "must."

## Skills and subagents

Here's something that surprises people: subagents don't automatically see your skills. When you delegate a task to a subagent, it starts with a fresh, clean context.

Important distinctions:

- Built-in agents (like Explorer, Plan, and Verify) can't access skills at all.
- Custom subagents you define can use skills, but only when you explicitly list them.
- Skills are loaded when the subagent starts, not on demand like in the main conversation.

To create a custom subagent with skills, add an agent markdown file in `.claude/agents`. You can use the `/agents` command in Claude Code to create one interactively. The generated agent file includes a `skills` field that lists which skills to load:

```markdown
---
name: frontend-security-accessibility-reviewer
description: "Use this agent when you need to review frontend code for accessibility..."
tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch, Skill...
model: sonnet
color: blue
skills: accessibility-audit, performance-check
---
```

When you delegate to this subagent, it has both skills loaded and applies them to every review. First make sure the skills exist in your `.claude/skills` directory, then either create a new subagent or add the `skills` field to an existing agent's markdown file.

This pattern works well when:

- You want isolated task delegation with specific expertise
- Different subagents need different skills (frontend reviewer vs. backend reviewer)
- You want to enforce standards in delegated work without relying on prompts

## Lesson reflection

- Which sharing method (repository, plugin, enterprise) makes the most sense for the skills you've been thinking about building?
- Do you have workflows where custom subagents with specific skills would improve consistency in delegated work?

## What's next

In the final lesson, you'll learn how to troubleshoot common skill issues — from skills that don't trigger, to priority conflicts, to runtime errors — with a practical checklist you can reference anytime.
