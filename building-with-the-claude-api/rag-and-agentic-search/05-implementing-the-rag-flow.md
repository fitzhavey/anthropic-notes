Now that we understand the RAG flow conceptually, let's implement it step by step — chunk text, generate embeddings, store them in a vector database, and perform similarity searches.

## The five-step RAG implementation

1. Chunk the text by section
2. Generate embeddings for each chunk
3. Create a vector store and add each embedding to it
4. Generate an embedding for the user's question
5. Search the store to find the most relevant chunks

## Step 1: Chunking the text

Load the document and split it into manageable sections:

```python
with open("./report.md", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

chunks = chunk_by_section(text)
chunks[2]  # Test to see the table of contents
```

We use the same `chunk_by_section` function from earlier to split our document into logical sections.

## Step 2: Generate embeddings

Create embeddings for all chunks at once:

```python
embeddings = generate_embedding(chunks)
```

The embedding function has been updated to handle both single strings and lists of strings, making it more efficient for batch processing.

## Step 3: Store in vector database

Create the vector store and populate it with embeddings and their associated text:

```python
store = VectorIndex()

for embedding, chunk in zip(embeddings, chunks):
    store.add_vector(embedding, {"content": chunk})
```

Notice that we store both the embedding and the original text content. This is crucial because when we search later, we need to return the actual text, not just the numerical embedding values.

### Why store the original text?

When we query our vector database, getting back just the embedding numbers isn't useful. We need the actual text that was used to generate those embeddings. That's why we include the original chunk text (or at least a reference to it) alongside each embedding.

## Step 4: Process user queries

When a user asks a question, generate an embedding for their query:

```python
user_embedding = generate_embedding("What did the software engineering dept do last year?")
```

## Step 5: Find relevant content

Search the vector store to find the most similar chunks:

```python
results = store.search(user_embedding, 2)

for doc, distance in results:
    print(distance, "\n", doc["content"][0:200], "\n")
```

This search returns the two most relevant chunks along with their similarity scores (cosine distances).

## Understanding the results

When we run our example query about the software engineering department, we get back:

- **Section 2: Software Engineering** with a distance of 0.71 (closest match)
- **Methodology** section with a distance of 0.72 (second closest)

Lower distance values indicate higher similarity, so Section 2 is the most relevant to our query.

## What's next?

This implementation works well for basic cases, but there are scenarios where it doesn't perform as expected. The next sections explore improvements to make the RAG system more robust and accurate.

The key takeaway is that RAG is fundamentally about converting text to numbers (embeddings), storing those numbers efficiently, and then using mathematical similarity to find relevant content when users ask questions.
