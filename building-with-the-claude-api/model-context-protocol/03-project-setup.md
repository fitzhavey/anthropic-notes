We're going to build a CLI-based chatbot to better understand how MCP clients and servers work together. This hands-on project gives you practical experience with both sides of the MCP architecture.

## What we're building

Our chatbot allows users to interact with a collection of documents through a command-line interface. The system consists of two main components:

- An MCP client that handles user interactions
- A custom MCP server that manages document operations

The server provides two essential tools: one for reading document contents and another for updating them. All documents are stored in memory for simplicity — no database required.

## Important architecture note

In real-world projects, you typically implement either an MCP client or an MCP server, not both. You might create:

- An MCP server to expose your service to other developers
- An MCP client to connect to existing MCP servers

We're building both components in this project purely for educational purposes — to understand how they communicate and work together.

## Project setup

Download the `cli_project.zip` file attached to this lesson and extract it to your preferred development directory. Open your code editor in the project folder. The project includes a comprehensive README with setup instructions:

1. Add your Anthropic API key to the `.env` file
2. Install dependencies using either UV (recommended) or pip
3. Run the starter application to verify everything works

## Running the application

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal. You'll see the main project files including `main.py`, `mcp_client.py`, and `mcp_server.py`. To start the application:

```bash
# If using UV (recommended)
uv run main.py

# If using standard Python
python main.py
```

When the application starts successfully, you'll see a chat prompt. Test it by asking a simple question like "what's 1+1?" — you should get a quick response from Claude.

With the basic setup complete, we're ready to start implementing MCP features and exploring how clients and servers communicate through the Model Context Protocol.
